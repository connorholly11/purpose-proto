# React Native to Web Migration Documentation

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the application from React Native/Expo to a pure web-based Next.js application.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Next.js Metadata Error**
   - Separated server and client components in the layout structure
   - Moved metadata export to server component (layout.tsx)
   - Created a client-layout.tsx for client-side logic

2. **Removed Mobile Dependencies**
   - Removed the following from package.json:
     - react-native-web
     - react-native-vector-icons
     - @testing-library/jest-native
     - @types/react-native-vector-icons
   - Created clean web-only dependencies

3. **Updated Theme System**
   - Created ThemeContext.web.tsx using localStorage instead of AsyncStorage
   - Removed React Native Paper theme dependencies
   - Created web-specific theme utilities

4. **Removed React Native Code**
   - Eliminated imports from 'react-native'
   - Removed React Native components like View, Text, etc.
   - Replaced with standard web elements

5. **Created Web Components**
   - Utilized our existing web components for UI elements
   - Removed platform-specific code

## Key Files Changed

1. **Layout Structure**
   - `/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`: Converted to server component for metadata
   - `/frontend/src/app/client-layout.tsx`: Contains client-side React code

2. **Theme System**
   - `/frontend/src/context/ThemeContext.web.tsx`: Web version of theme context
   - `/frontend/src/theme/styles.web.ts`: Web-only styling utilities

3. **Component Libraries**
   - Reused our existing web component library
   - Ensured all UI components are web-compatible

## Recommended Testing

1. **Verify Metadata Works**
   - Check that page titles and descriptions are properly set
   - Confirm that metadata is properly generated for SEO

2. **Check Theme System**
   - Test that theme switching works correctly
   - Verify that theme settings are persisted in localStorage

3. **Test Navigation**
   - Ensure all routes work properly
   - Verify that the main navigation UI is visible

4. **Review UI Components**
   - Confirm all components render properly in web browsers
   - Test responsive design across different screen sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Migration of Screens**
   - Continue migrating any remaining screens to web pages
   - Ensure all user flows are preserved

2. **Optimize Web Performance**
   - Implement proper code splitting
   - Add image optimization

3. **Enhance Responsiveness**
   - Add media queries for different device sizes
   - Test on various browsers and devices

4. **Clean Up Unused Files**
   - Remove any remaining mobile-specific files
   - Clean up unused imports and components

## Summary

This migration successfully transformed the application from a React Native/Expo-based mobile app to a pure Next.js web application. The changes preserve the existing functionality while leveraging web-specific technologies and patterns for better performance and maintainability.

Key benefits include:
- Proper metadata handling for SEO
- Web-optimized component library
- Elimination of mobile-specific dependencies
- Clean separation of client and server components
- Improved theme system using web storage

These changes allow the application to run purely on the web while maintaining its core functionality and user experience.
