# AI Companion Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the backend for the AI Companion application according to the requirements in the plan.md file. The backend provides API endpoints for chat, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, logs, and ratings.

## Implemented Features

- **Chat API**: Integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4o model to provide AI responses
- **Dynamic System Prompts**: Supports both "friendly" and "challenging" modes
- **Conversation Logging**: Stores all conversations with metadata
- **Rating System**: Allows thumbs up/down feedback on AI responses
- **TTS Integration**: Converts text to speech using Hume AI's TTS API
- **STT Integration**: Transcribes speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper API

## Directory Structure

├── .env                # Environment variables
├── logs.json           # Conversation logs

├── server.js           # Main server code
└── test.js             # Test script
```

## Testing Results

All implemented endpoints have been tested and are working correctly:

- `/api/chat`: Successfully communicates with OpenAI API using GPT-4o
- `/api/logs`: Correctly stores and retrieves conversation history
- `/api/rate`: Successfully updates ratings for conversations
- `/api/tts`: Successfully generates speech using Hume AI's TTS API
- `/api/stt`: Successfully transcribes audio using OpenAI's Whisper API

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For OpenAI API access (GPT-4o and Whisper)
- `HUME_API_KEY`: For Hume TTS API access
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3003)

## Next Steps

1. **Database Migration**: Move from file-based storage to a database for production
2. **Deployment**: Deploy the backend to a hosting service (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
3. **Enhanced Features**: Add conversation export, theme customization, etc.

## Conclusion

The backend implementation meets all the core requirements specified in the plan.md file. It provides a solid foundation for the AI Companion application with fully functional voice input and output capabilities.
