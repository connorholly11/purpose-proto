# AI Companion: Memory and RAG System

## Current Implementation

### Core Memory Architecture

Our AI companion utilizes a multi-level memory architecture designed to create more human-like interactions through persistent knowledge:

- **Short-term memory**: Recent conversation turns (5-8 messages)
- **Medium-term memory**: Conversation summaries created periodically
- **Long-term memory**: Persistent knowledge about the user stored in a knowledge base

The system automatically processes and stores information through several mechanisms:

1. **Automatic knowledge extraction** from user messages
2. **Periodic conversation summarization** (every 5 messages or 1 hour)
3. **Vectorized retrieval** of relevant memories during conversations
4. **Identity query enhancement** for questions about what the AI knows

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The current RAG implementation enhances AI responses by providing relevant context:

1. **Vectorization**: User messages and knowledge items are converted to vector embeddings
2. **Similarity Matching**: Cosine similarity identifies relevant knowledge (with thresholds)
3. **Context Injection**: Retrieved information is formatted and added to the AI's prompt
4. **Enhanced Response Generation**: The AI uses this additional context to create personalized responses

Key technical components:

- **Pinecone Vector Database**: Stores embeddings for efficient similarity search
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Converts text to vector representations
- **Custom Similarity Thresholds**: Different thresholds based on query types (0.45-0.65)
- **Special Query Detection**: Enhanced retrieval for "what do you know about me" type queries

### Knowledge Management

Personal information is managed through:

1. **Extraction Service**: Analyzes user messages to identify personal facts
2. **Knowledge Items**: Discrete facts stored with userId association
3. **Vector Indexing**: Facts are embedded and indexed for retrieval
4. **Dynamic Boosting**: Personal facts receive score boosts to increase recall

Current challenges with this approach:

- **Hard-coded thresholds** for determining relevance
- **Explicit formatting** of knowledge in system prompts
- **Manual detection** of identity-related queries
- **Rigid summarization** based on message counts or time intervals

### Recent Enhancements

Recent improvements to the memory system:

1. **Enhanced Personal Information Extraction**:
   - More generous extraction thresholds
   - Structured formatting of personal facts
   - Conversion of implicit information to explicit knowledge

2. **Improved Identity Query Handling**:
   - Special detection for "what do you know about me" type queries
   - Inclusion of ALL knowledge items for these queries
   - Boosted relevance scores for personal information

3. **Memory Optimization**:
   - More frequent summarization (5 messages vs 10)
   - Reduced time intervals (1 hour vs 2 hours)
   - Prioritization of personal details in memory

## Vision for Seamless Memory

The ultimate goal is to transcend our current explicitly programmed approach toward a seamless, human-like memory system. Instead of hard-coded rules, we envision a system that:

1. **Learns what to remember** based on salience and relevance
2. **Retrieves memories contextually** without explicit query construction
3. **Integrates knowledge naturally** without dedicated formatting
4. **Forgets appropriately** rather than remembering everything
5. **Builds a mental model** of the user that evolves organically

### Limitations of Current Approach

Our current implementation has several limitations:

- Hard-coded similarity thresholds (0.5, 0.65, etc.)
- Explicit detection of "identity queries" using keyword matching
- Manually crafted extraction prompts
- Rigid memory summarization intervals (5 messages, 1 hour)
- Forced knowledge formatting in system prompts
- Direct instructions to "never say you don't know" when knowledge exists

### Evolution Path for RAG and Memory

#### 1. Implicit Salience Detection

Instead of hard-coding what's "important enough" to remember:

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Neural attention to automatically focus on personally-relevant information
- **Importance Scoring**: Learned models that predict information importance
- **Contextual Embeddings**: Embeddings that capture the significance of information within conversation dynamics

```
// Future approach - learned salience detection
class SalienceDetector {
  async predictSalience(message, conversationContext) {
    // Neural model that analyzes message in context
    // Returns a salience score without hard thresholds
    return this.neuralModel.predict({
      message,
      context: conversationContext,
      userHistoricalInteractions
    });
  }
}
```

#### 2. Organic Memory Formation

Instead of explicit summarization intervals:

- **Continuous Memory Consolidation**: Background process that refines and reorganizes memory
- **Episodic-Semantic Transformation**: Convert conversation memories into semantic knowledge
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Strengthen memories that prove useful in future interactions
- **Decay Functions**: Naturally decreasing importance for non-reinforced memories

```
// Future approach - organic memory consolidation
class MemoryConsolidation {
  async processMemoryStreams() {
    // Continuously run in background
    while (true) {
      // Get recent episodic memories
      const recentMemories = await this.getRecentInteractions();
      
      // Identify patterns and extract semantic knowledge
      const newKnowledge = await this.episodicToSemantic(recentMemories);
      
      // Update knowledge graph with new semantic information
      await this.knowledgeGraph.integrate(newKnowledge);
      
      // Apply decay to non-reinforced memories
      await this.applyMemoryDecay();
      
      await sleep(CONSOLIDATION_INTERVAL);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Neural Memory Retrieval

Instead of explicit RAG pipelines with manual thresholds:

- **End-to-End Differentiable Retrieval**: Neural models that directly learn to retrieve
- **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Follow chains of relevant memories automatically
- **Dynamic Context Windows**: Adaptively determine how much context to include
- **Cross-Attention**: Directly attend to relevant parts of the memory store

```
// Future approach - neural memory retrieval
class NeuralMemoryRetrieval {
  async retrieveRelevantContext(query, userMemory) {
    // End-to-end neural retrieval without explicit embedding comparison
    const retrievalResults = await this.retriever.attend({
      query,
      memoryStore: userMemory,
      maxHops: 3  // Allow multi-hop reasoning
    });
    
    // Dynamically determine context window size based on relevance
    const contextWindow = this.contextSizer.predictSize(retrievalResults);
    
    return retrievalResults.slice(0, contextWindow);
  }
}
```

#### 4. Unified Knowledge Representation

Instead of separate memory systems:

- **Knowledge Graph**: A unified graph connecting entities, events, and attributes
- **Hierarchical Memory**: Information stored at multiple levels of abstraction
- **Associative Activation**: Memories triggering related memories through associations
- **Meta-Memory**: System awareness of what it knows and doesn't know

#### 5. Natural Memory Integration

Instead of explicitly formatted system prompts:

- **Learned Prompt Engineering**: Models that learn how to format memory for optimal response
- **Adaptive Memory Usage**: Incorporating only as much memory as beneficial
- **Uncertainty Representation**: Including confidence levels with recalled information
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Revealing memories at appropriate moments in conversation

### Technical Evolution Strategy

To evolve our RAG and memory systems:

1. **From Rules to Learning**:
   - Implement ML models to predict importance, relevance, and retrieval needs
   - Train on conversation logs to learn what information proves valuable later
   - Create feedback loops that improve memory models based on user satisfaction

2. **From Explicit to Implicit**:
   - Replace keyword matching with semantic understanding of query intent
   - Move from formatted system prompts to learned injection patterns
   - Shift from time/count-based summarization to content-based triggers

3. **From Siloed to Integrated**:
   - Unify the multiple memory systems (short/medium/long-term)
   - Create bidirectional communication between memory stores
   - Implement a unified knowledge representation framework

4. **From Static to Dynamic**:
   - Replace fixed similarity thresholds with adaptive relevance judgments
   - Implement dynamic context sizing based on information density
   - Create learning rates that adjust based on information importance

## Conclusion

Our current RAG and memory architecture provides a solid foundation through explicit rules and thresholds, allowing the AI companion to remember personal information and use it in conversations. While functional, this approach requires continual refinement and hard-coded logic.

The vision for the future is a seamless memory system that feels human-like in its ability to remember what matters, forget what doesn't, and naturally integrate memories into conversation. By evolving from rule-based approaches toward learning-based systems, we can create an AI companion that truly understands the significance of personal information and uses it to build meaningful relationships with users.

The ultimate goal is a memory system so natural that users forget it's there at all—until they realize, with delight, that their AI companion remembers something meaningful about them that deepens their connection.
