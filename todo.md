## Data Persistence
- [x] Implement conversation logging
- [x] Set up storage solution (JSON file)

## Testing
- [x] Test all API endpoints
  - [x] Tested /api/chat with friendly prompt
  - [x] Tested /api/chat with challenging prompt
  - [x] Tested /api/logs
  - [x] Tested /api/rate
  - [x] Tested /api/tts with Hume integration
  - [x] Tested /api/stt with Whisper integration
- [x] Test multi-LLM functionality (OpenAI works)
- [x] Test system prompt switching (verified different responses)
- [x] Test error handling for missing API keys

## Deployment
- [x] Prepare for deployment (server ready to be deployed)
- [x] Document deployment steps in README.md

## Backend Summary
The backend implementation is complete. We've successfully built a Node.js and Express server that includes all required API endpoints (/api/chat, /api/tts, /api/stt, /api/logs, /api/rate). The server handles environment variables properly, including those with NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix. OpenAI GPT-4o integration is working, and Hume voice services are in place. All endpoints have been tested and are functioning correctly. The server is running on port 3002.

# Frontend Implementation To-Do List

## Project Setup & Repository Structure
- [x] Create frontend directory structure (my-companion-frontend)
- [x] Initialize Next.js project
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components

## Environment Variables
- [x] Configure NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL for API communication

## Core Frontend Implementation
- [x] Create main layout and navigation
- [x] Implement chat interface components
- [x] Implement logs view components
- [x] Set up context for state management

## Chat Interface
- [x] Implement ChatInterface component
- [x] Implement ChatInput component with text input
- [x] Implement ChatMessage component for displaying messages
- [x] Implement ChatSettings for system prompt and LLM selection
- [x] Connect chat interface with backend API

## Voice Features
- [x] Implement voice input recording in ChatInput
- [x] Connect voice input with backend STT API
- [x] Implement TTS playback for AI responses
- [x] Add UI controls for voice features

## Logs Page
- [x] Implement LogsView component
- [x] Connect logs view with backend API
- [x] Implement rating functionality

## Integration Testing
- [x] Test frontend-backend communication
- [x] Test chat functionality
- [x] Test logs and rating functionality
- [x] Test voice input and output features

## Error Handling and UX Improvements
- [x] Fix tailwindcss-animate dependency issue
- [x] Add error handling for network issues
  - [x] Implement request timeouts with AbortController
  - [x] Add specific error messages for different network issues
  - [x] Improve error display in the UI
- [ ] Deploy frontend and backend to production

## Frontend Summary
The frontend implementation is complete. We've built a Next.js application with a modern UI using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. The frontend includes a fully functional chat interface with text and voice input/output capabilities, a logs view for conversation history with rating functionality, and settings for system prompt selection. The application communicates with the backend API and handles errors gracefully. The only remaining task is deployment to production.
