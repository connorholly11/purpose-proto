# Deprecated Components

This directory contains component files that are no longer actively used in the application but maintained for reference or backward compatibility.

## Contents

### Example Components

- `CrossPlatformExample.tsx` - A demonstration component showing cross-platform styling techniques. Currently only used in tests.

## Migration

Exports for these components are still maintained in the main `../index.ts` file to avoid breaking any existing imports.
